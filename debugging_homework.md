Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

The breakpoint identifies the line where the debugger should pause the application and open the debugger.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

The line of code doesn't run when you start debugging. It stops just before.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

We click the step over command that runs the current line and then moves on to the next line of code.

4. What does the step into command do?

The step into command allows you to navigate to the method itself and pause at the top of this method. This allows you to see what is going on in that particular instance.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluate expression allows us to write as single line of code and the code fragment allows us to write multiple lines of code. Evaluate doesn't need proper syntax endings but fragment does and it also allows us to declare instance variables.
